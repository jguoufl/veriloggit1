%% the netlist (*.scs) and verilog-A (*.va) scripts for cadence spectre simulations
%% include (1) inverter (worked) and sram (not yet worked) from my ballistic FETs (*my* in file name)
                , in the branches of inverter and sram
(2) tmdc FET codes, in the branch of tmdc

To run: spectre invert.scs
To visulaize: wavescan&
